    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is, effectively, the core plotting and data visualization package in Python. Many other packages use Matplotlib for data visualization, including pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. Matplotlib is not the only visualization package in Python, by any means. There are many others, including [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io), [ggpy](http://yhat.github.io/ggpy/), [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html), and [plot.ly](https://plot.ly). Some of the others are actually built on top of Matplotlib, but simply the syntax for creating specific, complex types of graphics relative to what's required in Matplotlib (these are called **wrappers** for Matplotlib). Others are entirely independent. Regardless, Matplotlib is the most widely-used and flexible package for data visualization in Python, and so it's valuable to learn it first, and then build out your skills from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is also a very mature Python package, having been first released in 2003 and continuously updated since then. It has a strong development community, a detailed website with extensive documentation and many examples, and there is copious third party documentation in the form of blog posts, books, and more — much of which is freely available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib's original developer, [John D. Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hunter) (1968-2012), was a neuroscience PhD student who needed to plot electrocorticography (ECoG) data (electrical data recorded directly from the surface of the brain). Hunter originally designed Matplotlib to emulate the plotting abilities of [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), but in Python. Matlab is a commercial programming language and environment, designed for — and widely used by — engineers and scientists. Hunter encountered limitations in Matlab that he wanted to work around. Because Matlab is a commercial product, rather than an open source one, development is controlled by a company (Mathworks). Although developers can write quite extensive and complex applications in Matlab, they are ultimately limited by the decisions that its developers have made. Hunter decided to switch his work to use Python, and wanted to develop a plotting interface that was similar to that used in Matlab. Indeed, this is where the \"Mat\" part of the name Matplotlib came from. "

A Python function that takes multiple arguments needs to know how to interpret each argument. Mandatory arguments typically are required to be listed in a particular order, which allows the function to know how to interpret each one.
