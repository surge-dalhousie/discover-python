    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is, effectively, the core plotting and data visualization package in Python. Many other packages use Matplotlib for data visualization, including pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. Matplotlib is not the only visualization package in Python, by any means. There are many others, including [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io), [ggpy](http://yhat.github.io/ggpy/), [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html), and [plot.ly](https://plot.ly). Some of the others are actually built on top of Matplotlib, but simply the syntax for creating specific, complex types of graphics relative to what's required in Matplotlib (these are called **wrappers** for Matplotlib). Others are entirely independent. Regardless, Matplotlib is the most widely-used and flexible package for data visualization in Python, and so it's valuable to learn it first, and then build out your skills from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is also a very mature Python package, having been first released in 2003 and continuously updated since then. It has a strong development community, a detailed website with extensive documentation and many examples, and there is copious third party documentation in the form of blog posts, books, and more — much of which is freely available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "As documented by Matplotlib's original developer, John Hunter, the package was originally designed to emulate the plotting abilities of [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), in Python. Matlab is a commercial programming language and environment, designed for — and widely used by — engineers and scientists. Hunter was conducting electrocorticography (ECoG) research and initially worked in Matlab, but encountered limitations that he wanted to work around. Because Matlab is a commercial product, rather than an open source one, development is controlled by a company (Mathworks). Although developers can write quite extensive and complex applications in Matlab, they are ultimately limited by the decisions that its developers have made. Hunter decided to switch his work to use Python, and wanted to develop a plotting interface that was similar to that used in Matlab. Indeed, this is where the \"Mat\" part of the name Matplotlib came from. "

Mandatory arguments typically are required to be listed in a particular order, which allows the function to know how to interpret each one.

These can be thought of as different colour schemes or templates for plots, which control many aspects of the plot appearance —  without the user needing to specify colours and styles for each line, or other details. This is done with a command telling Matplotlib which style to use, with the `plt.style.use()` function — which is run prior to the plot command.

    "## Procedural versus Object-Oriented Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most confusing things about learning Matplotlib is that it supports two fundamentally different ways of approaching plotting. These reflect two fundamentally different approaches used by different programming languages: *procedural* and *object-oriented*. Without going on too much of a tangent about this topic, we'll explain the essential differences below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language, however Matlab is a functional language. Thus in pursuing its initial goal of emulating Matlab's plotting functions, Matplotlib implemented a functional approach to generating plots. Subsequently however, an object-oriented approach was implemented as well. This means that when you encounter examples using Matplotlib \"in the wild\" — be that other people's code, tutorials, blog posts, etc. — you may see two rather different ways of doing the same thing, often with what may appear to be only subtle differences in the code. However, the two approaches are fundamentally different, and thus attempts to use snippets of code that you see in some examples may create errors, if you attempt to combine Matplotlib's functional and object-oriented approaches to generate a single figure. This is why we are addressing what may seem like a relatively esoteric topic in an introductory workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedural programming** is based around variables, data structures, and procedures — ways of operating on variables and data structures. In contrast, **object-oriented programming** is based around **objects**, which can have both data and methods in them. For example, pandas DataFrames are objects — they contain data, but they also have a set of methods that can operate on the data (e.g., `df.plot()`, `df.merge()`). The object-oriented approach is preferred because it is consistent with the rest of Python. That said, either way is acceptable; the most important thing is understanding the differences so as to avoid mixing the two and getting errors. "

    "### Object-Oriented Approach\n",
    "In contrast, the object-oriented approach involves starting by creating an instance of a Matplotlib `Figure` *object* and assigning it to a variable name (by convention, `fig`). Matplotlib allows a figure to contain more than one subplot; the set of subplots in a figure are called **axes** (each of the axes has an *x*-axis and a *y*-axis). Thus in creating a `Figure` object we need to assign it to a variable for the figure, and a list of the axes objects in the figure. Then we use methods on the individual axes to plot and modify the contents of each subplot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus to create a figure using the object-oriented approach, we can use the `plot.subplots()` command and assign its outputs to `fig` and `ax`: \n",
    "\n",
    "    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem confusing to use a command called `plt.subplots()` if we only want a single plot, but it is good practice to use this by default, so that you don't have to remember different commands for creating figures with one versus many subplots.\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "ax.plot(time, position)\n",
    "ax.set_title('Position over time')\n",

    "Although `plt.plot()` and `ax.plot()` look like similar commands, it's important to understand that they are actually very different: `plt.plot()` is a *function* that is part of the `plt` (`matplotlib.pyplot`) family of functions, whereas in `ax.plot()`, `ax` is a Matplotlib `Axes` object that we created, and `.plot()` is a *method* available to all `Figure` objects. This may become clearer if we note that rather than `fig`, we could assign the `Figure` object to any variable name we like, such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Whenever you are generating plots to go into a paper or a presentation, there are a few things you can do to make sure that everyone can understand your plots:\n",
    "- Always make sure your text is large enough to read. Use the `fontsize` parameter in `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, and `legend`, and `tick_params` with `labelsize` to increase the text size of the numbers on your axes.\n",
    "- Similarly, you should make your graph elements easy to see. Use `s` to increase the size of your scatterplot markers and `linewidth` to increase the sizes of your plot lines.\n",
    "- Using `color` (and nothing else) to distinguish between different plot elements will make your plots *unreadable* to anyone who is colorblind, or who happens to have a black-and-white office printer. For lines, the `linestyle` parameter lets you use different types of lines. For scatterplots, `marker` lets you change the shape of your points. If you’re unsure about your colors, you can use [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) or [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) to simulate what your plots would look like to those with colorblindness.\n",
    "\n",
