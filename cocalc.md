# CoCalc

[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) is a cloud service that hosts Jupyter notebooks. It is designed for collaboration and for use in class teaching situations. It's pretty awesome. CoCalc uses a "freemium" pricing model, whereby you can use it for free, but get significant improvements in service through a paid plan. SURGE covers the cost of CoCalc for the Discover Coding series, so you will receive access to an upgraded account for free (for the duration of the series you registered for). At the start of the first session, attendees will receive an invitation link sent to the email address they registered with (typically your dal.ca or other school address). Follow this and the instructions to set up your password and other account settings.

At its core, CoCalc allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks (in a variety of prominent data science languages, including Python, R, and Julia), as well as open and run a terminal, create and edit Markdown files, and even create to-do lists! Each user logs into their own isolated environment, so your files and work are private from other students. Importantly, though, the teaching team will be able to see all of your files and code. They can do this in real time, similar to how people can collaborate "live" on Google Docs. This allows the teaching team to be able to look at your work and help you solve problems when you get stuck (but the teaching team can view all of your files). It's the closest thing to having a teacher come look over your shoulder and point out where you've gone wrong. 

CoCalc also allows Time Travel! It keeps track of every change you've made to a document, so that you can travel back in time if you accidentally delete something, or decide your earlier work was better, etc..  Your dog will never be able to eat your homework, and you will never have to worry about backups, or failed hard drives destroying your work for this class.

You should check out the [CoCalc Student Guide](https://doc.cocalc.com/teaching-students.html).

CoCalc is a great example of the value of open source software. It uses the open-source Jupyter project and free software tools like Python and Markdown. Moreover, it is actually a product of an open source project called SageMath. SageMath is a mathematical software platform that integrates Python, R, and a variety of other languages and tools (and indeed, you can run SageMath from within CoCalc). SageMath was created by mathematician (and skateboarder) [William Stein](https://wstein.org/) in 2005, when he was a professor at Harvard. He held a couple of other university faculty jobs before quitting in 2019 to run SageMath full time. CoCalc is a revenue-generating operation that helps pay his salary and support the ongoing development of SageMath.

There are a lot of other free Jupyter notebook services, including [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). These are worth knowing about, and you may want to use them for your own projects, or just for playing around, in the future. They don't offer the same great features of CoCalc for classes - in particular for Discover Coding, the ability for members of the teaching team to view your notebooks live during a session, to provide you with help. 

If you really like CoCalc, you can pay to use it yourself after Discover Coding ends. However, if you consider using these for data analysis in the future, be sure that any data you upload is anonymized and so uploading to a public (and likely US-based) server does not violate research ethics or privacy laws.
