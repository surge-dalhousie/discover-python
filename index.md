Welcome to the [SURGE](https://surgeinnovation.ca) [Discover Coding](https://surge-dalhousie.github.io/discover-coding/) Python-Gapminder workshop! This workshop is aimed at people from science disciplines who have no previous experience with a programming language. The total workshop takes 8-12 hours to complete, but is broken into shorter lessons. It can be run as a single-day workshop or a series of workshops across days or weeks. It's also fairly self-explanatory, and may be used for self-study or practice.
